                <h2>One of the most effective practices of self-care </h2>
                <p class="text-muted">Journaling is an exercise that has been around for well over thousands of years.
                    Journaling follows a simple process of writing your thoughts without any rules or restrictions. The
                    act of self-reflection and routinely putting one’s experiences, feelings, beliefs, and emotions on
                    paper can do more good than just help you feel better.

                    Especially when it comes to self-improvement and leading a mindful life, journaling can be a great
                    tool.</p>

                <h2 class="heading ">Journaling boosts mindfulness
                </h2>
                <p class="paragraph  ">Mindful journaling is asking yourself why you feel a certain way and then letting
                    it go out of your head and onto the paper. You question yourself about yourself and get to know your
                    values, your motives, the way you think, and how you feel.</p>

                <p class="paragraph "> You take into consideration more possible outcomes, study your situation, and
                    thus
                    shift your mindset. With the clarity of your thoughts, You stop going in the past, don’t look into
                    the future, and become truly present and mindful of your life.

                <h2 class="heading ">Journaling improves your mental health</h2>
                <p class="paragraph">Journaling allows you to openly express your emotions that you usually keep bottled
                    up. You get an opportunity to have full emotional disclosure and vent without ever being judged.
                    This helps you feel lighter. Seeing your thoughts written in front of you in their true form without
                    any edits helps you see the authenticity of your thinking.<br/>
                In doing so, you identify your triggers and learn to better handle them. When you
                    write down and figure out the thoughts that are upsetting, you feel happier, calmer, less anxious,
                    and experience overall better mental health.

                <h2>Journaling makes you a better thinker</h2>
                <p class="text-muted">Journaling is your private space for decision making without any judgment or
                    pressure. This facilitates new perspectives and idea generation. You write different possible
                    scenarios, examine the positive and negative implications, and make better choices.<br/>

                    You build self-awareness and discover things in your mind that might be affecting your behavior and
                    moods. You make your decisions and explanations more realistic and improvise better ways to achieve
                    your goals. You may find out that the thing you are stressing about might not be that big of a deal
                    and this helps you approach it in a more bold manner.

                <p> Has been keeping journals since she was 13 years old. She considers them to be her therapy sessions.
                    They’re all simple leather diaries, locked away in a safe in her home. Every boyfriend, every
                    relationship, her friendships, her work, her family — all of them are dissected on pages. Jen is not
                    the type to get into huge, verbal altercations with her boyfriends; her way of dealing with
                    relationship issues has always been to write in her diary, then have a discussion. That way she
                    always has the upper hand in fights, and never loses control.</p>
